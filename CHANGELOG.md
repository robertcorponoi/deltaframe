* Deltaframe is now exported as a default module so instead of using `import { Deltaframe } from './path/to/deltaframe.js` you can now use `import Deltaframe from './path/to/deltaframe.js'`.

0.2.0 / 2018-12-20
==================
* Added getters for various properties:
	- `timesRestarted`: Returns the number of times Deltaframe has had to restart due to the average fps dipping below the minimum fps.
	- `isRunning`: Returns `true` if the animation loop is currently running.
	- `isPaused`: Returns `true` if Deltaframe is paused.
	- `frame`: Returns the current frame number that animation is on.
	- `time`: Returns the current time of the animation.
	- `delta`: Returns the average time between frames at that moment.
* Changed the visibility change event to use `addEventListener` instead of `onVisibilityChange`.
* Added a new initialization option called `runTime` which can be used to specify a time, in milliseconds, that Deltaframe should run the animation for.
* Expanded test cases to account for the new `runTime` option being added.
